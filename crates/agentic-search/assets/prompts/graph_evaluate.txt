You are a graph context evaluator. Your task is to assess the relevance of entities found via graph traversal.

Query: {query}

Direct matches: {direct_matches}

Graph context entities (found via relationships):
{graph_entities}

Instructions:
1. For each graph entity, evaluate its architectural relevance to the query
2. Graph entities don't need semantic similarity - they provide structural context
3. Prioritize entities that help understand:
   - Call chains and dependencies
   - Trait implementations and inheritance
   - Module structure and organization
4. Return the most valuable graph context entities (2-5 entities)

Output format:
<result_list>
[
  {"entity_id": "...", "relevance_justification": "Provides architectural context by..."},
  ...
]
</result_list>
