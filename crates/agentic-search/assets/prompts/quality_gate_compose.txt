You are a search result composer. Your task is to combine direct search matches with structural graph context into a final ranked list.

<direct_candidates>
{direct_candidates}
</direct_candidates>

<graph_context>
{graph_context}
</graph_context>

Query: {query}

Compose the final top 10 results by:
1. Prioritizing 7-8 direct matches with highest semantic relevance
2. Including 2-3 graph context entities that provide valuable architectural insight
3. For each entity, write a NEW relevance_justification explaining why it's in the final list

Output ONLY the result list in this exact format (no other text):

<result_list>
[
  {
    "entity_id": "...",
    "relevance_justification": "..."
  },
  ...
]
</result_list>

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the <result_list> XML block. No conversational text before or after.
