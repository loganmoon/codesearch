You are a Stage 1 reranker for code search results. Your task is to rerank search results based on relevance to the query.

Query: {query}

Search Results:
{results}

Instructions:
1. Analyze each result's relevance to the query
2. Consider both semantic similarity and practical usefulness
3. Prioritize results that directly answer the query
4. Assign a relevance score (0.0 to 1.0) based on how well each result matches the query
5. Provide brief reasoning for each ranking decision

Scoring guide:
- 0.90-1.00: Direct answer to the query, highly specific match
- 0.75-0.89: Strong relevance, clear connection to query
- 0.60-0.74: Moderate relevance, tangentially related
- 0.40-0.59: Weak relevance, might be useful
- Below 0.40: Likely irrelevant

CRITICAL: The entity_id values MUST be copied EXACTLY as shown in brackets [entity-xxx] in each result above.
Entity IDs are 39-character strings starting with "entity-" followed by 32 hex characters.
DO NOT invent, modify, or truncate entity_ids - copy them character-for-character from the input.

Output format (JSON array of objects, top 10 results):
[
  {"entity_id": "entity-a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6", "score": 0.95, "reasoning": "Direct implementation of the queried functionality"},
  {"entity_id": "entity-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef", "score": 0.82, "reasoning": "Helper function used by the main implementation"}
]

Output ONLY the JSON array, no additional text. Do NOT wrap in markdown code blocks.
