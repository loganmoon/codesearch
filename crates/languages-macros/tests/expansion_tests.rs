fn test_macro_compiles() {
    // This test just verifies the macro crate compiles successfully
    // More detailed tests would use macrotest or trybuild crates
    assert!(true);

// Note: For comprehensive macro expansion testing, we would typically use
// the macrotest or trybuild crates. However, the best test is to actually
// use the macro in the languages crate with real language implementations,
// which will be done in Phase 3 (JavaScript implementation).
